                            less means an user can focus more on content of the web page. For layout I primarily
                            used CSS Flexbox. The theme is fully responsive.",

                            and layout, but also because I wanted to be free of any CSS frameworks or more advanced
                            CSS positioning techniques. Old good positions, float and clear, margins and paddings,
                            and Z-index
