                    My
                    interests include web app
                    development, photography, creating Photoshop fantasies, and
                    observing human behavior to better understand people. I strive
                    to describe such behaviors in the short stories I write.

                    Prior to migrating
                    to the U.S.
                    from my native Czech Republic, I studied mechanical engineering.
                    Iâ€™m currently studying web development at Salt Lake Community
                    College. I want to learn how to build modern Websites using
                    HTLM5, CSS, and JavaScript.
