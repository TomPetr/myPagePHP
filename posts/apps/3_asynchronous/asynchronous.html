            <p>
                When I was writing the code for my previous code snippet <a
                    href="../../codes/2_not-cropped-thumbnails/not-cropped.html"><strong>Not Cropped
                        Thumbnails</strong></a>, everything went well.
                For the sake of simplicity I hardcoded HTML code for each image, with their src path. I placed my
                JavaScript at the bottom of my page, just above the body closing tag, making sure the entire content of
                my page is fully loaded before And then I could do whatever I wanted to do in Javascript, as reading
                each individual image's natural sizes to be able to determine what CSS properties I should apply to
                them.

            </p>
            <p>
                But in this snippet, I wanted to obtain src for each image is from the source outside of HTML, as from
                the JSON file. I wanted to do it simple, without any XMLHttpRequest. I stored my JSON objet in local
                JavaScript <mark>"asynch.js"</mark> file, which is technically only the JSOM object stored in JavaScript
                text variable <mark>"var imgGal"</mark>. The data exchanged
                between a
                browser and a server can be only be a text anyway.
            </p>
            <p>I imported this file into my HTML file via <mark>"src="./asynch.json"</mark> tag, which I placed at
                the at the bottom of my page, just above the body closing tag and JavaScript file handling all the
                dynamic tasks on the webpage. Then I converted this JSON into JavaScript objects via <mark>var
                    imgObj = JSON.parse(imgGal);</mark>.

            </p>
            <p>At this point everything seemed to look so straightforward. I could access each image's src by running
                through each element of <mark>["images"]</mark> array.,and dynamically create HTML code for its
                placement on the page.
                So I eded up with HTML code for all images rendered by JavaScript. Then I needed to let the
                <mark>stylingFx</mark>
                function to read each image's natural sizes to determine what kind of CSS to apply on them, either
                <mark>width: 100%; height: auto;</mark> or <mark>width: auto; height: 100%;</mark>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it's where my problems started. Since the source for src attributes were created dynamically by
                JavaScript
                code, JavaScript started to act in asynchronous manner. It means it didn't wait for all images to be
                loaded into
                the page first, and only then to ran my <mark>stylingFx</mark> function. Instead, it run
                <mark>stylingFx</mark>
                function before
                all
                images were loaded, resulting trying to read the natural image's sizes of non existent images. This
                asynchronous
                behavior had to be stopped.
            </p>
            <p>I found the solution on <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event">developer.mozilla.org</a>
                website. Now <mark>stylingFx</mark> function runs only after entire page's content is loaded and
                everything works as desired.</p>
