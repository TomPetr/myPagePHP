                    I found web development to be the right area where all my interests meet- logic, problem solving and
                    abstract thinking for coding; graphic art and human behaviors for user's experience and visual
                    appearance; and lastly, story writing for creativity and imagination.

                    On this page I want to share the code snipets I created in process of solving the proplems
                    associated
                    with developing this site. Sharing and explaining how the snippets work helps me to thing obout the
                    problems more in depth and write more clear code.

                        <h2>Equal Height Opportunity</h2>
                        <p>Do you have on your website the columns with different length of their content? Do you want
                            them all to take the same
                            height because it looks much nicer? Do you want to want to use javascript instead of CSS to
                            control them, because
                            it's more fun and more controlling? There's how I made it.</p>

                        <p>This very simple code snipped shows how to display the whole beauty of images in thumbnails
                            gallery. All thumbnails have the same sizes, and width-to-height ratio, but the images
                            don’t. I don’t want let anything to retouch my images in the gallery, I don’t want my images
                            to be cropped.</p>
