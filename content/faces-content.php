                    I love taking the photos and playing with them in the Photoshop. Changing their colors, atmosphere,
                    and creating new fantasy. Or better to say, creating new face to the reality. Also I look at
                    websites as at the faces of their owners, how they want to be presented to the outside world.

                    On this page, I want to show the power of CSS, how different styling can change the page's
                    appearance. It's fascinating how creative it can be to apply different set of CSS rules to the same
                    HTML structure, and then, to watch how entire atmosphere changes. And it's when the page gets its
                    new face.

                            I created this theme because I like clean and minimalist Web
                            Design. I believe the good look can be achieved even with less
                            graphics and without compromising on page's functionality. The
                            less means an user can focus more on content of the web page. For layout I primarily
                            used CSS Flexbox. The theme is fully responsive.

                            Creating this theme I experimented how much can be achieved by only using text, couple
                            of images, a few different colors, and Font Awesome icons. For responsive web design I
                            used a Bootstrap CSS framework.

                            I have chosen my Funky theme as my main showcase because it... funky. I really enjoyed
                            working on this theme, not only because I let my imagination run wild with the colors
                            and layout, but also because I wanted to be free of any CSS frameworks or more advanced
                            CSS positioning techniques. Old good positions, float and clear, margins and paddings,
                            and Z-index
                            were my best friends while moving the elements to their desired spots. This theme is
                            mobile-friendly.
